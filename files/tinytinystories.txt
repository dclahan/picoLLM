Once upon a time, a cat chased a mouse. The mouse hid in a small hole.
The sun was shining bright. A dog barked loudly in the park.
Alice found a magic key. She opened an old wooden door.
Tim built a sandcastle. The waves came and washed it away.
A red apple fell from the tree. A rabbit came and ate it.
